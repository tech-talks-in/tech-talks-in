[K6.io](https://k6.io) is one such tool from well known opensource team graphna labs that enables basic to advance testing sceraios for the developers to test their API\'s and identify any potential blockages across the service by writing tests in their well known scripting language \'javascript\'. This blog article guides you to quickly setup and run the load test in literaly in 5 minutes. YES in 5, can\'t beleive jump write in\\n\\n**Features :**\\n\\n- available as opensource and also SaaS \\n- Script tests in Javascript\\n- Supports 3rd party integrations and extensions\\n- quick to setup and use\\n\\nLets Begin...  \x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n1. Install k6\\n- for mac os with homebrew package manager \\n    ```\\n    brew install k6\\n    ```\\n\\n- for linux or debian follow these steps\\n    ```\\n    sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69\\n    echo \\"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main\\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list\\n    sudo apt-get update\\n    sudo apt-get install k6\\n    ```\\n - refer k6 documentation for additional options [k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/)\\n\\n 2. Get started with test scripts\\n To perform testing on your web application & apis; create new script file for example ***script.js*** and use below sample code  \\n\\n\\n ```\\n    import http from \'k6/http\';\\n    import { sleep } from \'k6\';\\n\\n    export default function () {\\n    http.get(\'https://test.k6.io\');\\n    sleep(1);\\n    }\\n\\n ```\\n\\n **If you are feeling to do more use below script**\\n\\n ```\\nimport {check} from \'k6\';\\nimport http from \'k6/http\';\\n\\nconst URL = \'https://dummyjson.com/products/1\'\\n// const SEARCH_URL = \'https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=phone\'\\n\\n\\nvar params = {\\n    Headers: {\\n        \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\',\\n        // \'Authorization\':\'Bearer your key or bearer tokens for the api endpoint\'\\n    },\\n};\\n\\n// Simple Get request for 5 concuerrent in 3 s\\n\\nexport let options = {\\n    vus: 5,\\n    duration: \'30s\'\\n}\\n\\n\\nexport default function () {\\n    let res = http.get(URL, params);\\n    // console.log(res)\\n    check(res, {\\n        \'is status 200\': (r) => r.status ===200\\n    });\\n}\\n\\n ```\\n\\n3. Run the tests - use the command ``` k6 run script.js``` where script.js is the file name in step 2 above. script file can be named anything, as a best practice name it base don on waht script is expected to do\\n\\n4. By default it uses 1 virtual user, for running multiple users or simultaneous users use ``` k6 run --vus 5 --duration 30s script.js``` this refers to 5 virtual users for the duration of 30 seconds. Add or change numbers based on what you are trying to acheive. Also can be added to the script under options object. Additional options are available, refer to [K6 documentation](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/running-k6/)\\n\\n4. Results are displayed upon compeletion with required metrices for users broadly classifed into 2\\n    - As summary statistics, in an end-of-test summary report.\\n    - In granular details, with measurements for every data point across test (and timestamps)\\n5.

In this article, we will be taking a look at some of the most popular platforms and features available in the CDP and DMP space.\\n\\n**I. Introduction**\\nManaging customer data effectively is crucial for any business that wants to stay competitive in today\'s digital landscape. With the abundance of data available, it can be difficult to make sense of it all, but having a clear understanding of your customers can help you make better decisions, improve customer engagement, and ultimately drive more revenue.\\n\\n**Overview CDP and DMP**\\nCustomer Data Platform (CDP) and a Data Management Platform (DMP) are both systems that help organizations manage and analyze customer data. However, they have different focuses and use cases. A CDP is primarily focused on creating a single customer view, while a DMP is focused on segmentation and targeting.\\n\\n### II. What is a Customer Data Platform (CDP)?\\n\\nA Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a system that centralizes, cleans, and manages customer data from various sources, such as website interactions, marketing campaigns, and CRM systems. It aims to provide a single source of truth for customer data, allowing organizations to better understand and engage with their customers\\n\\n- Key functionality - CDP centralizes, cleans, and manages customer data\\n\\n  CDPs collect data from various sources, such as website interactions, marketing campaigns, and CRM systems, and then centralize it in a single location. This allows organizations to have a comprehensive view of their customers. The data is also cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy. CDPs can also merge duplicate data to create a single customer profile.\\n\\n- Usecase : CDP can be used to improve customer engagement and understanding\\n\\n  CDPs can be used to personalize marketing campaigns and website experiences for individual customers. By providing a complete view of customer data, CDPs can help organizations identify and target specific segments of customers, such as high-value customers or those at risk of churn. CDPs can also be used to track customer interactions and preferences over time, allowing organizations to build more meaningful relationships with their customers.\\n\\n### III. What is a Data Management Platform (DMP)?\\n\\nA Data Management Platform (DMP) is a system that collects, organizes, and segments data from various sources, such as website interactions, marketing campaigns, and CRM systems. It aims to provide actionable insights and targeted marketing opportunities through the creation of audience segments.\\n\\n- Key functionality - DMP collects, organizes, and segments data\\n\\n  DMPs collect data from a variety of sources and organize it into audience segments. These segments can be based on demographics, behavior, interests, or other characteristics. The data is then used to create targeted marketing campaigns, identify high-value audiences, and optimize ad spend.\\n\\n-  Usecase : DMP can be used to improve targeting and audience insights\\n\\n  DMPs can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns that reach specific segments of customers. By identifying high-value audiences, organizations can optimize their ad spend and reach the most valuable customers. DMPs can also be used to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing organizations to make data-driven decisions about how to engage with their customers.\\n\\n  IV. Comparison of CDP and DMP\\n\\n  Both CDP and DMPs are used to manage and analyze customer data, but they have different focuses. CDPs are primarily focused on creating a single customer view, while DMPs are focused on segmentation and targeting. Both systems collect and organize data from various sources, but CDPs are designed to provide a comprehensive view of the customer, while DMPs are designed to provide actionable insights and targeted marketing opportunities.\\n\\n  While CDPs and DMPs have different focuses, they can complement each other and be used together to create a more comprehensive customer data strategy. By using a CDP to create a single customer view, organizations can gain a better understanding of their customers and then use that information to create targeted segments with a DMP. This allows organizations to personalize their marketing efforts, optimize ad spend, and build more meaningful relationships with their customers.\\n\\n### V. List of Key players or Platforms\\n\\nThere are many different platforms available in the Customer Data Platform (CDP) and Data Management Platform (DMP) space, some popular ones include:\\n\\n1. Adobe Experience Cloud: Adobe Experience Cloud provides a CDP and DMP solution that allows organizations to create a single view of the customer and personalize marketing efforts.\\n\\n2.

It is important to evaluate the features and pricing of each platform to determine which one is the best fit for your organization\'s specific needs.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\nWe hope this article has given you a better understanding of the different platforms available in the CDP and DMP space and how they can help your organization better manage and analyze customer data. Remember, each organization has unique needs and requirements, so it\'s important to evaluate the features and pricing of each platform to determine which one is the best fit for your organization.

Look no further than sprint planning! In this article, we\'ll dive into the world of Agile methodology and explore the importance of sprint activities in delivering value to customers in a timely manner. From sprint planning and daily scrum meetings, to sprint review and retrospective, we\'ve got you covered. So buckle up and let\'s get started on our sprint journey! \\n\\n**What is a Sprint?** \\nA sprint is a time-boxed period in Agile software development, typically lasting between one and four weeks(though 2 weeks is quite common across software development teams), during which a defined set of work is completed. The goal of a sprint is to deliver a potentially releasable product increment.\\n\\nEffective sprint planning, execution, and review are essential for project success. By breaking down work into smaller, manageable chunks, sprints allow teams to quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver value to customers in a timely manner.\\n\\n**Importance of Sprint in Agile Methodology**\\nSprints are a key component of Agile methodology, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid feedback. By breaking down work into smaller, manageable chunks, sprints allow teams to quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver value to customers in a timely manner.\\n\\n**Purpose of Sprint Activities**\\nThe purpose of sprint activities is to plan, execute, and review the work that will be completed during the sprint in order to deliver a potentially releasable product increment. These activities include sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.\\n\\n**Key Roles and Responsibilities**\\n- **The Scrum Master** is responsible for facilitating the meeting, ensuring that it stays on track, and addressing any issues that arise. \\n- **The Product Owner** is responsible for presenting the backlog and prioritizing tasks. \\n- **The development team** is responsible for estimating the time and effort required to complete the tasks and identifying any dependencies or risks.\\n\\n### Sprint Planning\\n\\nSprint planning is a collaborative effort between the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner. Before the sprint planning meeting, the team should set clear goals for the sprint and create a backlog of tasks to be completed.\\n\\n- Setting Goals: The team should identify the goals for the sprint, including what features or functionality they want to deliver, and what improvements they want to make to the product.\\n\\n- Creating a Backlog: The Product Owner is responsible for creating and prioritizing a backlog of tasks that need to be completed during the sprint. The backlog should be reviewed and refined before the sprint planning meeting.\\n\\n- The Sprint Planning Meeting: During the sprint planning meeting, the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner will review the goals and backlog, and plan how to achieve them during the sprint.\\n\\nEstimating and Prioritizing Tasks: During the sprint planning meeting, the development team will estimate the time and effort required to complete each task in the backlog. The team will then prioritize the tasks based on the goals for the sprint and the priorities set by the Product Owner.\\n\\n### Sprint Execution\\n-  Daily Scrum Meetings: Daily scrum meetings are short, 15-minute meetings that are held every day during the sprint. The purpose of these meetings is to give the development team an opportunity to plan their work for the day, and to identify any issues that need to be addressed.\\n\\n- The daily scrum meeting follows a simple structure, with each team member answering three questions: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers or issues?\\n\\n- Benefits for Team and Project: Daily scrum meetings help to ensure that the development team is on track to meet the sprint goals, and they provide an opportunity for the team to quickly address any issues or blockers that may arise.\\n\\n- Sprint Review: The sprint review is a meeting held at the end of each sprint to review the work that has been completed and to get feedback from stakeholders. The agenda for the sprint review should include a demonstration of the new features or functionality, a review of the sprint goals, and a discussion of any issues or risks that need to be addressed. The sprint review is an opportunity for stakeholders, such as the Product Owner, customers, and other members of the organization, to provide feedback and input on the work that has been completed. This feedback can be used to adjust the backlog and priorities for the next sprint.\\n\\n- Sprint Retrospective: The sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint to review the sprint process and identify areas for improvement. The outcomes of the sprint retrospective should include actionable items that can be implemented in the next sprint to improve the overall process. During the sprint retrospective, the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner should review the sprint process, including the sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review, and any other activities that were conducted. They should identify any challenges that arose and look for ways to improve the process in the next sprint.\\n\\n### Typical daily tasks in a 2 weeks sprint plan\\n\\nThe daily tasks for a 10-day sprint will depend on the specific goals and tasks that have been defined during the sprint planning meeting. However, here is a general outline of daily tasks that may be completed during a 10-day sprint:\\n\\n**Day 1:**\\n\\n1. Review sprint goals and backlog\\n2. Identify and prioritize tasks for the day\\n3. Begin work on high-priority tasks\\n\\n**Day 2-9:**\\n\\n1. Attend daily scrum meeting to review progress and plan for the day\\n2. Continue work on high-priority tasks\\n3. Address any issues or blockers that arise\\n4. Participate in team collaboration and knowledge-sharing\\n5. Continuously update task status on the tracking tool\\n\\n**Day 10** (Last Day of the Sprint)\\n\\n1. Wrap up any remaining tasks\\n2. Prepare for the sprint review and retrospective meetings\\n3. Review and update the backlog for the next sprint\\n4. Submit completed work for review\\n\\nIt is also important to note that the daily scrum meeting is an important part of the sprint process, and should be held every day, regardless of the day in the sprint. This daily meeting helps the team to stay on track, identify any issues or blockers, and ensure that the sprint goals are being met.\\n\\n\\n### Recap of key takeaways\\nSprints are a key component of Agile methodology, which allows teams to deliver value to customers in a timely manner. Sprint activities include sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. These activities help teams to plan, execute, and review the work that will be completed during the sprint in order to deliver a potentially releasable product increment.\\n\\nSprint activities can be implemented in any type of project, not just software development. By following the steps outlined in this article, one can start to implement sprints in their own projects and experience the benefits of Agile methodology.\\n\\n### Additional Resources \\nTo learn more about Agile methodology and sprints, refer to resources such as the Scrum Guide, \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\" by Mike Cohn, and \\"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\\" by Jeff Sutherland.\\n\\nThere are many tools available to assist with sprint planning and execution, such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), and [monday.com](https://www.momday.com).

It is typically used to securely transmit information between a server and a client, such as an API and a single-page application. JWTs are a useful tool for securely transmitting information between parties, and are commonly used in modern web applications for authentication and authorization\\n\\nA JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims. Registered claims are a set of predefined claims that are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of the registered claims are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and others. Public claims are claims that are defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or defined in other specifications, but are not registered. Private claims are claims that are used to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims...\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn\'t changed along the way. The signature is created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, and signing that. For example, if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:\\n\\nHMACSHA256(\\nbase64UrlEncode(header) + \\".\\" +\\nbase64UrlEncode(payload),\\nsecret)\\n\\nTo verify the signature, the recipient of the JWT needs to compute the signature and compare it to the one provided in the JWT. If they match, the JWT is considered to be valid.\\n\\nJWTs are commonly used to authenticate users. When a user logs in to a system, the server generates a JWT that contains the user\'s information, such as the user\'s name, email, and other details, and signs it with a secret. The JWT is then sent back to the client, where it is stored in a cookie or local storage. When the client makes a request to the server, it includes the JWT in the request header. The server verifies the signature and, if it is valid, grants the client access to the requested resource.\\n\\nJWTs have a number of benefits over traditional authentication methods, such as cookies and sessions. They are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store any information about the client in order to verify the JWT. This makes them scalable and easy to implement. They are also secure, as they are signed and can\'t be modified without the signature being invalidated.\\n\\n**Example**\\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c\\n\\nThis JWT has three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which consists of the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. In this case, the claims are the subject (sub), which is the user\'s ID, and the name (name) of the user. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn\'t changed along the way.\\n\\nHere is the same JWT, with the parts decoded:\\n\\nHeader:\\n{\\n\\"alg\\": \\"HS256\\",\\n\\"typ\\": \\"JWT\\"\\n}\\n\\nPayload:\\n{\\n\\"sub\\": \\"1234567890\\",\\n\\"name\\": \\"John Doe\\",\\n\\"iat\\": 1516239022\\n}\\n\\nTo create this JWT, you would first need to create the header and payload as JSON objects, and then encode them using base64Url encoding. Then, you would create the signature by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm.\\n\\nTo verify the signature of this JWT, you would need to decode the header and payload and then recompute the signature using the same algorithm and secret. If the signature you compute matches the one provided in the JWT, the JWT is considered to be valid.\\n\\n**nodejs sample**\\n\\nTo use JWTs in a Node.js application, you can use the jsonwebtoken library. This library provides functions for creating and verifying JWTs.\\n\\nHere is an example of how you can use the jsonwebtoken library to create a JWT:\\n\\n```js\\nconst jwt = require(\'jsonwebtoken\');\\n\\nconst payload = {\\n  sub: \'1234567890\',\\n  name: \'John Doe\'\\n};\\n\\nconst secret = \'my-secret\';\\n\\nconst token = jwt.sign(payload, secret);\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe sign() function takes the payload and the secret as arguments, and returns the JWT. The payload can be any JSON object, and the secret is a string that is used to sign the JWT.\\n\\nHere is an example of how you can use the jsonwebtoken library to verify a JWT:\\n\\n```js\\nconst jwt = require(\'jsonwebtoken\');\\n\\nconst token = \'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c\';\\nconst secret = \'my-secret\';\\n\\ntry {\\n  const payload = jwt.verify(token, secret);\\n  console.log(payload);\\n} catch (error) {\\n  console.error(error);\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe verify() function takes the JWT and the secret as arguments, and returns the payload if the signature is valid. If the signature is invalid, it throws an error.\\n\\nYou can also pass additional options to the sign() and verify() functions, such as the expiration time of the JWT or the audience for which the JWT is intended."},{"id":"digital-marketing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/digital-marketing","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-05-digital-marketing.md","title":"From Social Media to SEO: Navigating the World of Digital Marketing","description":"Digital marketing refers to the use of digital channels and technologies to promote products or services.
